# Retaining Uber Drivers // [Shay Redmond](http://shay.works) 

## Good Product Contest Submission

**Prompt**: *Imagine you had to build a new feature to help Uber retain their drivers. What are some features/tools that would improve the retention/churn of drivers?*

## Drivers Community
One of the most unique and difficult to emulate offerings is a community. When products ignite a community of users around a shared interest, often those communities outlive the product itself. These communities can often keep customers around even when competing companies offer a better or cheaper product. 

For this reason, I would invest in a "Drivers Community". This would be a deeply integrated space for drivers to connect with, and support one another, learn new skills and share ideas. This community could include paid services for its members, like:
-   car maintenance lessons
-   hospitality certifications
-   coaching to navigate complex social interactions i.e., political discussions 
-   training to understand different accessibility challenges for riders


Drivers should feel like they're growing as a person by being part of this community, and even if a rival ride sharing company has a better app/better rates/etc, this community could become one of the key retention pillars if done correctly. Drivers should feel like Uber supports them and is investing in them becoming better drivers, better hosts, better people and creating a safer platform for them to be a part of.

We've seen that this happens organically elsewhere , Deliveroo cyclists forming chat groups to help, share recommendations, and connect with each other. In Ireland we've seen several buyouts of Uber-like products from Hailo to MyTaxi to Freenow. Through each buyout every driver I've spoken to has reiterated that Hailo got it right from day one. They were invested in their drivers first, and making them feel like part of one team, like they were part of a collective community at Hailo.

Communities are a difficult to copy feature, and Uber has an opportunity to create the community for their drivers.

## Making it a reality
To pull it off, I would recommend the following: 
1.  Create a space in-app where drivers can communicate with each other, a forum-like UX, including a high level of involvement by Uber-led trust and safety employees to ensure this feels like a co-owned community.
2.  Have Uber-employed local Community Leaders who could work with drivers to understand needs and organise training sessions and community meet ups, all organised through the in-app Community Forum
   -   Being in-app is critical to ensuring this community cannot be replicated off-platform. Perhaps the app is the only way users can register and be admitted to these events.
4.  Curate a driver-led Community Leader program where drivers themselves can create their own communities solving their own local goals/challenges.
   -   This program could include stipends for training resources, hosting events, etc. Successful Leaders could also get a bonus from Uber for maintaining a successful community, measured by attendance and high-NPS.
6.  Allow ad-hoc communities to form organically by drivers once we’ve fully understood what the differentiated “walled garden” play is for the in-app community space.
   -   Must ensure that there is added benefit for both parties by remaining in the Uber app ecosystem.
